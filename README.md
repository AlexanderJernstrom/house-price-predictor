# House price predictor

### About the project

This is my first data science and python project. I have ,tried to, built a statistical model that can predict price of a house in Stockholm based on four parameters, bedrooms, price per squaremeter, square meter and municipality. For the municipality I got a list of the all the municipalities in Stockholm. Then I sorted the municipalities based average price. After that I gave each municipality a number, 1 is most expensive and 26 is the cheapest. Of course there are other factors that play in when setting a price for a house. This meant for a rough estimate.

The data comes from the Swedish listing site hemnet (hemnet.se). I got the data by scraping their site. [Link to scraper repository](https://github.com/AlexanderJernstrom/house-price-scraper).
